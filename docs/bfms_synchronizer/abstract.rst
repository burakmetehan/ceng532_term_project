========

This document explores Byzantine failures and delves into the Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer, a robust algorithm designed to achieve clock synchronization even in the presence of byzantine processes. We discuss the challenges of byzantine failures, provide an overview of related work, and present the Mahaney-Schneider synchronizer in detail. This includes pseudocode for the algorithm, an illustrative example, analysis of its correctness, and complexity considerations. Finally, we explore potential implementation approaches, discuss results and limitations, and conclude by highlighting the significance of this technique and potential areas for future research.
