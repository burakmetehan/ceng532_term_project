This document explores the concept of Mutual Exclusion and delves into the details of the Agrawal-El Abbadi algorithm, a distributed solution for ensuring exclusive access to critical sections in a network of processes. The document covers the algorithm's background, related work, its structure with pseudocode, correctness proofs, and complexity analysis. Additionally, it discusses potential implementation strategies, along with results and analysis of its performance. Finally, the document concludes with a summary of the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses, outlining potential areas for future exploration.
